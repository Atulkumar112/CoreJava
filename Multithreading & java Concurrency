https://www.guru99.com/multithreading-java.html

Thread:- Thread is the light-weight sub-process, which has its own files and stacks and can access the shared data from other threads in the same process.
It's the smallest unit of processing.
Multithreads:- Multithreading is a process of excecuting multiple threads simultaneously to maximum utilization of CPU. Multithreaded applications execute two or 
more threads run concurrently. Hence, it is also known as Concurrency in Java.
--> Multithreading and multiprocessing both are used to achieve multitasking.
--> First of all we use multithreaidng and then multiprocessing.
--> Threads use a shared memory areas.
--> Threads takes less time than process.
--> Threads is light-weight process whereas process is heavy weight process.
--> multithreading is mostly used in games and annimation.
